  summary: Async Direct Submission
  description: |
    Perform a submission to BioStudies using the page tab inside the given file. Please be have in mind the following:
    * The given page tab should match the format in the file i.e. if the file is submission.json, it should contain JSON format.
    * Regardless of the chosen format to submit, the page tab document in the response will always be returned in JSON format
    * Any referenced file should be either placed in the user folder or attached to the request using the Files parameter. Please have in mind that the amount of files that can be directly attached to the request is limited, if the submission has too many files, please place them in the user directory.
    * If no accession number is provided, a new submission will be created and the corresponding accession number will be generated
    * If an accession number is provided, the submission will be treated as a resubmission which will perform an update
